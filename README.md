[Demo CMP App Using KSafe](https://github.com/ioannisa/KSafeDemo)

Whether you must squirrel away OAuth tokens in a fintech app or remember the last‚Äëvisited screen of your game, KSafe stores the data encrypted with platform-specific secure key storage and hands it back to you like a normal variable.

***

## Why use KSafe?

* **Hardware-backed security** üîê AES‚Äë256‚ÄëGCM with keys stored in Android Keystore or iOS Keychain for maximum protection.
* **Clean reinstalls** üßπ Automatic cleanup ensures fresh starts after app reinstallation on both platforms.
* **One code path** No expect/actual juggling‚Äîyour common code owns the vault.
* **Ease of use** `var launchCount by ksafe(0)` ‚Äîthat is literally it.
* **Versatility** Primitives, data classes, sealed hierarchies, lists, sets; all accepted.
* **Performance** Suspend API keeps the UI thread free; direct API is there when you need blocking simplicity.

## How encryption works under the hood

KSafe provides enterprise-grade encrypted persistence using DataStore Preferences with platform-specific secure key storage.

##### Android
* **Cipher:** AES‚Äë256‚ÄëGCM
* **Key Storage:** Android Keystore (hardware-backed when available)
* **Security:** Keys are non-exportable, app-bound, and automatically deleted on uninstall
* **Access Control:** Keys only accessible when device is unlocked

##### iOS
* **Cipher:** AES‚Äë256‚ÄëGCM via OpenSSL-3 provider
* **Key Storage:** iOS Keychain Services
* **Security:** Protected by device passcode/biometrics, not included in backups
* **Access Control**: `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`
* **Reinstall Handling:** Automatic cleanup of orphaned Keychain entries on first use

##### Flow

* **Serialize value ‚Üí plaintext bytes** using kotlinx.serialization.
* **Load (or generate) a random 256‚Äëbit AES key**  from Keystore/Keychain (unique per preference key)
* **Encrypt with AES‚ÄëGCM** (nonce + auth‚Äëtag included).
* **Persist Base64(ciphertext)** in DataStore under `encrypted_<key>`
* **Keys managed by platform** - never stored in DataStore

Because GCM carries its own authentication tag, any tampering with data is detected on decryption. Platform-managed keys provide hardware-backed security where available.

## Setup ‚öôÔ∏è
Add the KSafe dependency to your `build.gradle.kts` (or `build.gradle`) file.

### Library Installation

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/eu.anifantakis/ksafe.svg?label=Maven%20Central)](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/eu.anifantakis/ksafe)

#### 1 - Add the Dependency
```kotlin
// commonMain or Android-only build.gradle(.kts)
implementation("eu.anifantakis:ksafe:1.1.0")
implementation("eu.anifantakis:ksafe-compose:1.1.0") // ‚Üê Compose state (optional)
```

> Skip `ksafe-compose` if your project doesn‚Äôt use Jetpack Compose, or if you don't intend to use the library's `mutableStateOf` persistance option

#### 2 - Apply the kotlinx‚Äëserialization plugin

If you want to use the library with data classes, you need to enable Serialization at your project.

Add Serialization definition to your `plugins` section of your `libs.versions.toml` 
```toml
[versions]
kotlin = "2.1.21"

[plugins]
kotlin-serialization = { id = "org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.serialization", version.ref = "kotlin" }
```

and apply it at the same section of your `build.gradle.kts` file.
```Kotlin
plugins {
    ...
    alias(libs.plugins.kotlin.serialization)
}
```

*** 

#### Library Instantiation with Koin

Koin is the defacto DI solution for Kotlin Multiplatform, and is the ideal tool to provde as a singleton the KSafe library. 

```Kotlin
// common
expect val platformModule: Module

// Android
actual val platformModule get() = module {
    single { KSafe(androidApplication()) }
}

// iOS
actual val platformModule get() = module {
    single { KSafe() }
}
```

And now you're ready to inject KSafe to your ViewModels :)

*** 

### Usage üöÄ

##### Quick Start (One Liner)
`var counter by ksafe(0)`

params:
* `defaultValue` must be declared (type is infered by it)
* `key` if not set the variable name is used as a key
* `encrypted` by default is set to true (uses Keystore/Keychain)

The above wat is easiest to utilize the library with property delegation, that provides out of the box, intuitive way to encrypted persisted values.  All you need is `by ksafe(x)`

```Kotlin
import eu.anifantakis.lib.ksafe.KSafe

class MyViewModel(ksafe: KSafe): ViewModel() {
    var counter by ksafe(0)

    init {
        // then just use it as a regular variable
        counter++
    }
}
```

##### Composable State (One Liner)
`var counter by ksafe.mutableStateOf(0))`

Recomposition‚Äëproof and survives process death with zero boilerplate.

That is a composable state, but to make use of it you need to have imported the second dependency in our installation guide that includes compose.

```Kotlin
import eu.anifantakis.lib.ksafe.KSafe

class MyViewModel(ksafe: KSafe): ViewModel() {
    var counter by ksafe.mutableStateOf(0)
        private set

    init {
        // then just use it as a regular variable
        counter++
    }
}
```

#### Storing complex objects

```Kotlin
@Serializable
data class AuthInfo(
    val accessToken: String = "",
    val refreshToken: String = "",
    val expiresIn: Long = 0L
)

var authInfo by ksafe(AuthInfo())   // encryption + JSON automatically

// Update
authInfo = authInfo.copy(accessToken = "newToken")
```
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Seeing "Serializer for class X' is not found"?
Add `@Serializable` and make sure you have added Serialization plugin to your app

#### Suspend API (non‚Äëblocking)

```Kotlin
// inside coroutine / suspend fn
ksafe.put("profile", userProfile)          // encrypt & persist
val cached: User = ksafe.get("profile", User())
```

#### Direct API (Good for Tests)
```Kotlin
ksafe.putDirect("counter", 42)
val n = ksafe.getDirect("counter", 0)
```

#### Jetpack Compose ‚ô• KSafe (optional module)
as already mentioned above, Recomposition‚Äëproof and survives process death with zero boilerplate.
```Kotlin
var clicks by ksafe.mutableStateOf(0)  // encrypted backing storage
actionButton { clicks++ }
```

#### Deleting data
```Kotlin
ksafe.delete("profile")       // suspend (non‚Äëblocking)
ksafe.deleteDirect("profile") // blocking
```

When you delete a value, both the data and its associated encryption key are removed from the secure storage (Keystore/Keychain).

#### Full ViewModel example
```Kotlin
class CounterViewModel(ksafe: KSafe) : ViewModel() {
    // regular Compose state (not persisted)
    var volatile by mutableStateOf(0)
        private set

    // persisted Compose state (AES encrypted)
    var persisted by ksafe.mutableStateOf(100)
        private set

    // plain property‚Äëdelegate preference
    var hits by ksafe(0)

    fun inc() {
        volatile++
        persisted++
        hits++
    }
}
```

## Security Features
### Platform-Specific Protection

#### Android
* Keys stored in Android Keystore
* Hardware-backed encryption when available
* Keys bound to your application
* Automatic cleanup on app uninstall

#### iOS
* Keys stored in iOS Keychain Services
* Protected by device authentication
* Not included in iCloud/iTunes backups
* Automatic cleanup of orphaned keys on first app use after reinstall

### Error Handling
If decryption fails (e.g., corrupted data or missing key), KSafe gracefully returns the default value, ensuring your app continues to function.

### Reinstall Behavior
KSafe ensures clean reinstalls on both platforms:
* **Android:** Keystore entries automatically deleted on uninstall
* **iOS:** Orphaned Keychain entries detected and cleaned on first use after reinstall

This means users always get a fresh start when reinstalling your app, with no lingering encrypted data from previous installations.

### Technical Details

#### iOS Keychain Cleanup Mechanism
On iOS, KSafe uses a smart detection system:

* **Installation ID:** Each app install gets a unique ID stored in DataStore
* **First Access:** On first get/put operation after install, cleanup runs
* **Orphan Detection:** Compares Keychain entries with DataStore entries
* **Automatic Removal:** Deletes any Keychain keys without matching DataStore data

#### Known Limitations

* **iOS:** Keychain access requires device to be unlocked
* **Android:** Some devices may not have hardware-backed keystore
* **Both:** Encrypted data is lost if encryption keys are deleted (by design for security)
