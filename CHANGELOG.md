# Changelog

All notable changes to KSafe will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-12-31

### Added

#### Standalone Biometric Authentication
- **New `verifyBiometric()` suspend function** - Coroutine-based biometric verification
- **New `verifyBiometricDirect()` callback function** - Non-blocking biometric verification for any context
- **Biometric authentication is now decoupled from storage** - Use it to protect any action (API calls, navigation, data display), not just KSafe operations

#### Authorization Duration Caching
- **New `BiometricAuthorizationDuration` data class** for configuring cached authentication:
  ```kotlin
  data class BiometricAuthorizationDuration(
      val duration: Long,       // Duration in milliseconds
      val scope: String? = null // Optional scope identifier
  )
  ```
- **Duration caching** - Avoid repeated biometric prompts by caching successful auth for a specified duration
- **Scoped authorization** - Different scopes maintain separate auth timestamps for fine-grained control
- **Recommended pattern**: Use `viewModelScope.hashCode().toString()` for ViewModel-scoped auth that auto-invalidates when the ViewModel is recreated

#### Authorization Management
- **New `clearBiometricAuth()` function** - Force re-authentication by clearing cached auth
  - `clearBiometricAuth()` - Clear all cached authorizations
  - `clearBiometricAuth(scope)` - Clear only a specific scope

### Changed
- **iOS thread safety improvements** - Biometric callbacks now always execute on Main thread

---

## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-15

### Added
- **Hybrid "Hot Cache" Architecture** - Zero-latency UI reads with async preloading
- **Memory Security Policy** - Choose between `ENCRYPTED` (max security) or `PLAIN_TEXT` (max performance)
- **Nullable value support** - Correctly store and retrieve `null` values
- **Multiple KSafe instances** - Create separate instances with different file names
- **JVM/Desktop support** - Full support alongside Android and iOS
- **KSafeConfig** - Configurable encryption parameters (key size)
- **Lazy loading option** - Defer data loading until first access

### Changed
- `getDirect()` now performs atomic memory lookup (O(1)) instead of blocking disk read
- `putDirect()` uses optimistic updates - immediate cache update with background persistence
- Eager preloading on initialization by default (use `lazyLoad = true` to defer)

---
